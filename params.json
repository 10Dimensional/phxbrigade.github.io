  "body": "# Code for Phoenix\r\n=================\r\n## What is Code for America?\r\n\r\nCode for America is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, designers, planners, doers, and activists.\r\n\r\n## What is the Code for Phoenix Brigade?\r\n\r\nCode for Phoenix is a local chapter of the Code for America [Brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/about), an international network of people committed to using their minds, voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better.\r\n\r\n## The Vision\r\n\r\nCode for Phoenix is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their involvement.\r\n\r\n## Where can you find out about upcoming events?\r\n\r\nPlease join our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/codeforphx/) page.\r\n\r\nBuilt by Phoenix brigade members [Michael Hwan](https://github.com/michaelhwan), and more to come!\r\n",
